# react-native-jose #

A JavaScript implementation of the JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) for React Native.
This repo is a clone of [node-jose](https://github.com/cisco/node-jose) which handles the issue
with the **zlib** module on React Native.

It uses the [react-zlib-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-zlib-js) package and the
[Browserify's version of the buffer module from node.js](https://github.com/feross/buffer).

## Documentation

See the [node-jose](https://github.com/cisco/node-jose) documentation.
